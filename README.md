# Vector Google Daydream

This is my personal project where I try to connect the Google Daydream to the Vector Robot. How I typically do my development is work off example codes and try to build it from there. It might be right, but it works for me. 

I'll be writing up a setup process on how I did this.

- [Anki Vector](https://www.anki.com/en-us/vector)
